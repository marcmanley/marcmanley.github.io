		<p><img src="media/imgs/img_8557.jpg" alt="Marc Manley" width="175"> Who am I? Well, to help explain that I'd have to tell you what I've done and what I'm doing.</p>
		<p>Like a lotta folks, I didn't start off life in technology but instead came to it through a very circuitous route. I started off life washing dishes and in some way, that has prepped me to one of life's little secrets: never be afraid to get your hands dirty! From there I studied culinary arts, as I have a real passion for cooking and eating. Working in a kitchen is a magical thing: you take raw ingredients and transform them into something worthy of eating through knowledge of how those ingredients work with one another. This would be another one of life's secrets revealed to me.</p>
		<p>From there I pursued my creative impulses in the fields of photography and music. Both of these opened up avenues into technology as photography was making the transition to digital as was music. I even grabbed a spot on WEMU (89,1FM) spinning jazz, an experience that would greatly serve me in public speaking and podcasting. I also managed to squeeze in a stint as a cab driver in between all of that.</p>
		<p>I've been a creative and technology professional for over 25 years, working in academic, corporate, and non-profit settings, making technology accessible, practical and productive.  I possess a wide range of technical skills (see below), having worked in the fields of <strong>Project Management</strong> and <strong>Document Management</strong> to <strong>Information Architecture</strong>, <strong>Instructional Technology</strong>, <strong>Web Development</strong> and <strong>Desktop Support</strong>.</p>
		<p>Through the years, I have striven to develop a solid track record of consistently exceeding project goals in management expectations and project execution. Strong communication skills forms the backbone of my work ethic. A self-motivated worker, I thrive in performance-oriented atmospheres and competitive environments. Above all, I am always looking for ways to keep working and to make work enjoyable for those around me.</p>

		<h1>Technical Skills</h1>
			
			<p>I am able to bring a wide array of skills and experiences to any project, no matter the size. I have an extensive background in photography (digital and analog), video capture and editing, and lend my background in graphic design in creating engaging and provocative social media campaigns and engagements, from shooting still images or video, producing music to go along with them or providing voice overs for your campaigns.</p>
